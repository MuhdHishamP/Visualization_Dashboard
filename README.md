# Visualization Dashboard
This React app serves as a Visualization Dashboard that
                retrieves information from a Django Rest Framework API connected
                to a PostgreSQL database. The data is used to generate various
                types of charts to help you analyze and visualize trends.  Line Charts, Bar Charts, Polar Area
                Charts, and Pie Charts are generated based on the provided data.
